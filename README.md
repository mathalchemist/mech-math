# Mech-Math MSU programs

This repository is a base of all Mech-Math MSU programs which will help you not only to somehow pass 4 yeras of programming, but also to learn something.

There are lot of serious problems with the archive at [DMVN](http://dmvn.mexmat.ru/prog.php):
  1. Last time it was updated in 2006 since those times lots of contributions made by students were lost.
  2. The code in it is extremely trashy, so if you want to understand what's going on probably you will fail.
  3. Not all problems are covered.
  4. Absence of any documentation.
  5. Most of code is written in C not C++ style.
  6. After Mech-Math you will not learn even basics of git which you definitely need in order to work in any group or even making solo projects.

## How to start contributing?
  1. `git clone` this repository to your local machine.
  2. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME`.
  3. Make all the work in your local branch.
