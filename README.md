# Mech-Math MSU programs

This repository is a base of all Mech-Math MSU programs which will help you not only to somehow pass 4 yeras of programming, but also to learn something.

There are a lot of serious problems with the archive at [DMVN](http://dmvn.mexmat.ru/prog.php):
  1. Last time it was updated in 2006 since those times lots of contributions made by students were lost.
  2. The code in it is extremely trashy, so if you want to understand what's going on probably you will fail.
  3. Not all problems are covered.
  4. Absence of any documentation.
  5. Most of code is written in C not C++ style.
  6. After Mech-Math you will not learn even basics of git which you definitely need in order to work in any group or even making solo projects.

## Requests for code
  If you need some problem's solution or explanations, please check [Issues](https://github.com/MSU-Programming/mech-math/issues) section and if there is no similar request then [open new issue](https://github.com/MSU-Programming/mech-math/issues/new).

## How to start contributing?
  1. `git clone` this repository to your local machine.
  2. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME`.
  3. Make all the work in your local branch.
  4. `git push` it to remote repository.
  5. Create a pull-request to the master branch.

### Example for dummies (Linux / OS X)
  1. Open your terminal
  2. `git clone https://github.com/MSU-Programming/mech-math.git`
  3. `cd mech-math`
  4. `git checkout -b SOME_GOOD_BRANCH_NAME`
  5. Edit / create / delete files
  6. `git add changed_file_1 changed_file_2 ...`
  7. `git commit -m "Some really clever comment about your changes"`
  8. `git push origin SOME_GOOD_BRANCH_NAME`
  9. Go to GitHub page and create the pull-request
